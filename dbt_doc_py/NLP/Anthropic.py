    metricsGuidelines = """General Information:
        A metric is an aggregation over a table that supports zero or more dimensions.
        Metric names must:
            contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (no spaces or special characters)
            begin with a letter
            contain no more than 250 characters


        Available properties (Define aspects of the metric)
        Field: name
        Description: A unique identifier for the metric
        Example: new_customers
        ---
        Field: model
        Description: The dbt model that powers this metric
        Example: dim_customers
        ---
        Field: label
        Description: A short for name / label for the metric
        Example: New Customers
        ---
        Field: description
        Description: Long form, human-readable description for the metric
        Example: The number of customers who....
        ---
        Field: calculation_method
        Description: The method of calculation (aggregation or derived) that is applied to the expression
        Example: count_distinct
        ---
        Field: expression
        Description: The expression to aggregate/calculate over
        Example: user_id, cast(user_id as int)
        Guidelines: You can't use * as expression in the metric. It can be used only as a SQL expression (for instance count(*))
                    For expressions that needs math operations (sum,average,median) make sure you are using a numeric column (acoording the provided data type of the column).
        ---
        Field: timestamp
        Description: 
        Example: signup_date
        ---
        Field: time_grains
        Description: One or more "grains" at which the metric can be evaluated. For more information, see the "Custom Calendar" section.
        Example: [day, week, month, quarter, year]
        ---
        Field: dimensions
        Description: A list of dimensions to group or filter the metric by
        Example: [plan, country]
        ---
        Field: window
        Description: A dictionary for aggregating over a window of time. Used for rolling metrics such as 14 day rolling average. Acceptable periods are: [day,week,month, year, all_time]
        Example: {{count: 14, period: day}}
        ---
        Field: filters
        Description: A list of filters to apply before calculating the metric
        Guideline: Filters should be defined as a list of dictionaries that define predicates for the metric. Filters are combined using AND clauses. For more control, users can (and should) include the complex logic in the model powering the metric.
                All three properties (field, operator, value) are required for each defined filter.

        Available calculation methods (The method of calculation (aggregation or derived) that is applied to the expression)
        Method: count
        Description: This metric type will apply the count aggregation to the specified field
        ---
        Method: count_distinct
        Description: This metric type will apply the count aggregation to the specified field, with an additional distinct statement inside the aggregation
        ---

        ---
        Method: median
        Description: This metric type will apply the median aggregation to the specified field, or an alternative percentile_cont aggregation if median is not available
        ---
        Method: derived
        Description: This metric type is defined as any non-aggregating calculation of 1 or more metrics
